Created for Ludum Dare 32, with the theme 'unconventional weapon'. The idea of the game is to bounce the ball around obstacles to kill the enemies.

The game makes use of the Chipmunk physics library built into Cocos2d-x, as well as the particle effects engine, tilemap, sound, and animation features.
